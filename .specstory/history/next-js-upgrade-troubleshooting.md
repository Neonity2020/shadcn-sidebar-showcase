_**Assistant**_

Let me help you address these warnings and errors:

1. First, for the main error about failing to get the Next.js version, you need to ensure:
   - You're running the command from the correct directory (where your Next.js project is located)
   - You have Next.js installed in your project

Here's what you should do:

1. First, verify you have Next.js in your project:

```bash
npm list next
```

2. If Next.js isn't installed, install it:

```bash
npm install next@latest
```

3. Then try running the codemod again:

```bash
npx @next/codemod@latest upgrade
```

As for the npm warnings you're seeing:
- These are deprecation warnings for some dependencies, but they shouldn't block your upgrade
- These are internal dependencies that will likely be updated in future versions

If you're still having issues, you can try:

1. Clearing your npm cache:
```bash
npm cache clean --force
```

2. Delete node_modules and reinstall:
```bash
rm -rf node_modules
npm install
```

Then try the upgrade command again.

If you're using a monorepo (multiple projects in one repository), make sure to:
1. Navigate to the specific Next.js project directory
2. Run the codemod command from that directory

Let me know if you're still experiencing issues after trying these steps!

For the code present, we get this error:
```
File 'c:/Users/Administrator/Documents/GitHub/shadcn-sidebar-showcase/data/books.ts' is not a module.
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

The error indicates that `data/books.ts` either doesn't exist or isn't properly exported. Let's create the file with the necessary types and data:

```typescript:data/books.ts
export interface Book {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  status: 'completed' | 'reading' | 'planned';
  progress: number;
  directories?: string[];
  downloadUrl: string;
}

export const books: Book[] = [
  {
    id: "book-1",
    title: "Sample Book 1",
    description: "Sample description",
    status: "reading",
    progress: 45,
    directories: ["Chapter 1", "Chapter 2", "Chapter 3"],
    downloadUrl: "#"
  },
  // Add more books as needed
];
```

This will resolve both the module error and the implicit 'any' type errors in your page component.

For the code present, we get this error:
```
'"@/data/books"' has no exported member named 'books'. Did you mean 'Book'?
```
How can I resolve this? If you propose a fix, please make it concise.

_**Assistant**_

The error occurs because the export name changed from `books` to `projects`. Let's update the import in the page file:

```typescript:app/history/page.tsx
// ... existing code ...
import { Book, projects } from "@/data/books"

export default function Page() {
  const [currentPage, setCurrentPage] = useState(1);
  const pageSize = 3;
  const totalPages = Math.ceil(projects.length / pageSize);

  const currentProjects = projects.slice(
    // ... existing code ...
```

Make sure to replace
